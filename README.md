# FaceDetection
**Face detection** is a branch of **image processing** that uses machine learning to **detect faces in images, videos or on live stream**


### FaceDetection is the Algorithm to find the face in the video or in Live Stream


* Running on the Ubuntu system 

### LiveDetection 

    > python3 FaceRecognition.py // For Live detection of the video

### ImageDetection

    > python3 ImageDetection.py // for Images 

### VideoDetection

    > python3 VideoStream.py // For videos


* Running on Windows 

1. Open your favirote idle
2. clone this repo
3. open FaceRecognition.py file
4. run FaceRecognition.py // For Live
5. Now visit your **data** folder, you can file faces in this folder

* Work with Images and Videos also on Windows

:point_right: Just change the File from ***Point 4***


that's it, now check in your data folder we are going to see the image of the face

it will give exact frame where algorithm was detecting the face

:point_right: **Note** :- Everything Will be is on Live Stream only
